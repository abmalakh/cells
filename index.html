            <p>
                Hi there, thanks for checking out this explorable thing!
                Right now this page is early in development, so expect missing content, bugs, and spelling mistakes~
                Note: Not designed for mobile, sorry, I'm working on it.
            </p>

            <h2>[TODO] Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                Add some introductory text that introduces CAs as simulations of extremely simple universes,
                or something like that. Make them sound cool and exciting!
            </p>

            <p>What is the simplest interesting universe we can create?</p>

            <h2>The Elementary Cellular Automata</h2>

            <p>
                Our quest to create the simplest non-trivial universe simulation will follow in the footsteps of
                Stephen Wolfram, and his work on the elementary cellular automata (I'll be referring to them from
                now on as ECA).
            </p>

            <p>
                A cellular automaton (<i>automata</i> is plural), is a function that takes in a set of cells on a grid,
                and performs some simple computations to produce a new grid of cells. An ECA is a specific type of
                cellular automata, one that only exists in one dimension, with cells that have two possible states.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each cell in an ECA can either be dead (shown with a light background) or alive (shown with a black background and later
                on in this article with coloured backgrounds). Here's a view of the world that our ECA exists in:
            </p>

            <div class="playable p1">
            	<p>Interactive: Life and death</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Each cell's neighbours are the other cells within a certain distance.
                Because an ECA is the most basic cellular automata, each cell only has one neighbour to each side:
            </p>

            <div class="playable p2">
            	<p>Interactive: Neighbours</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Make sure you play with the above interactive a little bit to get a feel of how neighbours work,
                especially at the edge of the simulation (if we can't see a cell we'll assume its dead).
            </p>

            <p>
                A cell's neighbourhood is made up of the left neighbour, the cell itself, and the right neighbour:
            </p>

            <div class="playable p3">
            	<p>Interactive: Neighbourhoods</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                It's important to remember that neighbourhoods don't just impact the cell in the middle, changing a cell will
                affect the neighbourhoods of those around it too! To get a feel for this, try and solve this little puzzle
                (or just move on, it's up to you):
            </p>

            <div class="playable p4">
            	<p>Interactive: neighbourhoods puzzle</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                See? Making changes to a cell can cause others around it to change too.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alright, now you're ready for the real deal, here's an extremely simple ECA,
                it looks for cells with a neighbourhood of ◼︎◻︎◼︎ and then outputs a live cell when it sees one
                (hover over an output cell to see its neighbours in the previous generation):
            </p>

            <div class="playable p5">
            	<p>Interactive: Single neighbourhood rule, one generation</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Still, this isn't super exciting... But wait! What if we fed the output through the ECA again?
                Each pass through the ECA is called a "generation", here's the same ECA as before but with two generations this time:
            </p>

			<div class="playable p6">
				<p>Interactive: Single neighbourhood rule, two generations</p>
			</div>

            <p>
                This is more interesting, and we can start to create patterns,
                but we're only creating a living output cell when we see one specific type of neighbourhood.
                An ECA has 8 different types of neighbourhoods, they are (in binary order):
            </p>

            <p>
                ◻︎◻︎◻︎, ◻︎◻︎◼︎, ◻︎◼︎◻︎, ◻︎◼︎◼︎, ◼︎◻︎◻︎, ◼︎◻︎◼︎, ◼︎◼︎◻︎, ◼︎◼︎◼︎
            </p>

            <!--
			<div class="playable p7">
				<p>Interactive: Binary -> Neighbourhood </p>
			</div> -->

            <p>
                Here are the first 3 generations of an ECA with switches that control neighbourhood evolution each generation:
            </p>

            <div class="playable p8">
            	<p>Interactive: All neighbourhoods, 1 generation</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The convention is that the input cells of an ECA usually contain only one living cell in the middle,
                and that the generations are stacked below it to form a grid that shows its evolution over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's a playground that follows the conventions and allows you to edit the rules with the buttons
                or by clicking the cells themselves (clicking a cell will toggle the button that matches its neighbours in the previous generation):
            </p>

            <div class="playable p-final"></div>
